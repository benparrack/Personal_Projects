# Personal_Projects
A repository to store all of my learning and personal project endeavors

This entire workspace is dedicated to learning python and improving my skills, along with any personal projects. A large chunk is going to be following along with an online course, and then hopefully from there working on 
personal projects. Eventually I'd like to create my own website, making the frontend and backend myself, and fill it with my projects. Cheers to the future!


Notes:
At one point I had divergent branches, so I had to run <git config pull.rebase false> to let vscode know to merge the branches
Could've decided to rebase branches too by making it true, but merging seems to be safer
