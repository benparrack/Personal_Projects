# Personal_Projects
**A repository to store all of my learning and personal project endeavors**

This entire workspace is dedicated to learning python and improving my skills, along with any personal projects. A large chunk is going to be following along with an online course, and then hopefully from there working on 
personal projects. Eventually I'd like to create my own website, making the frontend and backend myself, and fill it with my projects. Cheers to the future!


Notes:
At one point I had divergent branches, so I had to run {git config pull.rebase false} to let vscode know to merge the branches.
Could've decided to rebase branches too by making it true, but merging seems to be safer.

My code originally wouldn't pop up a window when I tried to, and it turned out to be because I was in a codespace and the file wasn;t running locally so there wasn't a virtual environment to support it.
To fix this I copied over all my files from the codespace to a local folder on my computer, downloaded python and added it to my PATH by disabling the auto-download from microsoft store (windows automatically expects you to downlaod python from them icrosoft store)
